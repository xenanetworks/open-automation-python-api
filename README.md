**``xoa-driver`` is discontinued. It is replaced by [tdl-xoa-driver](https://github.com/xenanetworks/tdl-xoa-driver).**

Please uninstall ``xoa-driver`` from your environment and install ``tdl-xoa-driver``. The APIs and imported module remain the same so you don't need to change your scripts.





# Xena OpenAutomation Python API
Xena OpenAutomation Python API is a standalone Python library that provides a user-friendly and powerful interface for automating network testing tasks using Xena Networks test equipment. Xena test equipment is a high-performance network test device designed for testing and measuring the performance of network equipment and applications.

## Introduction
The XOA Python API is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other automation tools and frameworks. It provides a comprehensive set of methods and classes for interacting with Xena test equipment, including the ability to create and run complex test scenarios, generate and analyze traffic at line rate, and perform detailed analysis of network performance and behavior.

The XOA Python API simplifies the process of automating network testing tasks using Xena test equipment. It provides a simple, yet powerful, interface for interacting with Xena test equipment using the Python programming language. With the XOA Python API, network engineers and testing professionals can easily create and execute test scenarios, generate and analyze traffic, and perform detailed analysis of network performance and behavior, all while leveraging the power and flexibility of the Python programming language.

Overall, the XOA Python API is a valuable tool for anyone looking to automate their network testing tasks using Xena test equipment. With its simple, yet powerful, interface and support for the Python programming language, the XOA Python API provides a flexible and extensible framework for automating network testing tasks and improving the quality of network infrastructure.

## Documentation
The user documentation is hosted:
[Xena OpenAutomation Python API Documentation](https://docs.xenanetworks.com/projects/xoa-python-api)

## Key Features
* Objected-oriented, high-level abstraction, to help users save time on parsing command responses.
* Supporting sending commands in batches to increase code execution efficiency.
* Automatically matching command requests and server response, providing clear information in case a command gets an error response.
* Supporting server-to-client push notification, and event subscription, to reduce user code complexity.
* Covering commands of Xena testers, including Xena Valkyrie, Vulcan, and Chimera.
* Supporting IDE auto-complete with built-in class/function/API use manual, to increase development efficiency.


## Installation

### Install Using `pip`
Make sure Python `pip` is installed on you system. If you are using virtualenv, then pip is already installed into environments created by virtualenv, and using sudo is not needed. If you do not have pip installed, download this file: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py and run `python get-pip.py`.

To install the latest, use pip to install from pypi:
``` shell
~/> pip install xoa-driver
```

To upgrade to the latest, use pip to upgrade from pypi:
``` shell
~/> pip install xoa-driver --upgrade
```

### Install From Source Code
Make sure these packages are installed ``wheel``, ``setuptools`` on your system.

Install ``setuptools`` using pip:
``` shell
~/> pip install wheel setuptools
```

To install source of python packages:
``` shell
/xoa_driver> python setup.py install
```

To build ``.whl`` file for distribution:
``` shell
/xoa_driver> python setup.py bdist_wheel
```


## Quick Start

* Get Python pip if not already installed (Download https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py):
    `python get-pip.py`

* Install the latest xoa-driver:
    `pip install xoa-driver -U`

* Write Python code to manage with Xena testers:
    ```python
    import asyncio

    from xoa_driver import testers
    from xoa_driver import modules
    from xoa_driver import ports
    from xoa_driver import enums
    from xoa_driver import utils

    async def my_awesome_func():
        # Establish connection with a Valkyrie tester
        async with testers.L23Tester("10.10.10.10", "JonDoe") as tester:
            # Get the port 0/0 (module 0)
            port = await tester.modules.obtain(0).ports.obtain(0)

            # Reserve the port
            await port.reservation.set_reserve()

            # Reset the port
            await port.reset.set()

            # Create a stream on the port
            stream = await port.streams.create()

            # Prepare stream header protocol
            header_protocol = [enums.ProtocolOption.ETHERNET, enums.ProtocolOption.IP]

            # Batch configure the stream
            await utils.apply(
                stream.tpld_id.set(0), # Create the TPLD index of stream
                stream.packet.length.set(*size), # Configure the packet size
                stream.packet.header.protocol.set(header_protocol), # Configure the packet type
                stream.packet.header.data.set(header), # Configure the packet header
                stream.enable.set_on(), # Enable streams
                stream.rate.fraction.set(1000000) # Configure the stream rate 100%
            )

            # Clear statistics
            await utils.apply(
                port.statistics.tx.clear.set(),
                port.statistics.rx.clear.set()
            )

            # Start traffic on the port
            await port.traffic.state.set_start()

            # Test duration 10 seconds
            await asyncio.sleep(10)

            # Query TX statistics
            tx_result = await port.statistics.tx.total.get()
            print(f"bit count last second: {tx_result.bit_count_last_sec}")
            print(f"packet count last second: {tx_result.packet_count_last_sec}")
            print(f"byte count since cleared: {tx_result.byte_count_since_cleared}")
            print(f"packet count since cleared: {tx_result.packet_count_since_cleared}")

            # Stop traffic on the port
            await port.traffic.state.set_stop()

            # Release the port
            await port.reservation.set_release()

    def main():
        try:
            loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
            loop.create_task(my_awesome_func())
            loop.run_forever()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            pass

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        main()
    ```
